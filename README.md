This repository contains code that I wrote for my master thesis. 

Two datasets are used of which one is the famous MNIST dataset. It is a built-in dataset in the library `keras`. The other one is the Wine Quality Data Set and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

The latter one needs to be stored in a folder called "data" at this level of the folder path.
